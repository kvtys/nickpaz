    title: "Site Specific Project",
    description: `For the site specific topic I wanted to tackle issues of cell phone usage and how pollution is tied to cell phones and how it impacts sea life. The manufacturing process of a smartphone accounts for up to 85% of its carbon footprint, which makes it one of the most harmful aspects to nature and especially sea life. Deep sea mining for materials like cobalt platinum and molybdenum, destroy sealife biomes, and copper mines contaminate the surrounding waters with a reddish orange color that affects the wildlife around the area. I decided to make two collages of different kinds of cell phones into the shape of two sea creatures, that show the effects of obtaining the minerals for your cell phone. I decided to use printed pictures of cellphones and put that on a large sheet of paper. The location on campus that I think would be the best is this wall in between two buildings. There is a lot of foot traffic in this area and it fits nicely on the wall.`,

    title: "Social Practice Project",
    description: `Following the site specific project I wanted to stay on the topic of smartphone use. For the social practice project i decided to tackle disturbing topics with the same correlation to smartphone use, addiction. Many people don't think about their addiction to technology the same ways people look at drugs, so I wanted to portray that in another collage. The image on the left are some earlier ideas and the image on the right is the finished work. The finished Work talks about three different ideas, overstimulation, (top) addiction, (left) and brokenness (right). Overstimulation is shown through the limited space that the brain has, and it is being taken up by apps. Addiction follows someone putting needles into their arm that are filled with popular apps like youtube, spotify, and facebook. Broken is a representation of how powerful apps are and how they break something that is meant to keep them contained (wine bottle). The collage is on a large piece of paper and the project is magazine cut outs that were glued onto it. The apps that I used in each one are printed pieces of paper.`,

    description: `For the 60 second project I took a different approach to what art truly is. My hair is an important way that i reflect myself, so i wanted to put this on a sheet of paper and explore different ideas. The image on the top represents chaos in which my hair is going in a bunch of different directions. The image on the bottom is a representation of my hair exploring human concepts such as love as seen with my hair making small hearts in a symmetrical way on the paper. I decided to portray my hair not showing my face to emphasize how impactful and expressive hair can be. `,

I made the collage out of pine needles from dead pine branches. The image on the right is the logo for Peru which is made out of sticks. I decided to explore these different ideas for the environmental project because of my heritage and spread more awareness towards Peruvian culture.`,

    title: "Self Directed Project",
    description: `The self directed project is the last installment for my time in the class New Art Forms. This was my favorite project to work on as I had entire creative control on what i was making/ trying to portray. I painted over 4 vinyl records that are 7', and i decided to tackle different feeling and emotions with each one that I have been feeling during the 2024 spring semester. The 12' vinyl with the four quadrants represent how I want to be feeling instead. The image on the bottom right is what I will be referencing to explain these themes. The vinyl on the top left is my take on anger and hatred. I used colors associated with fire to portray chaos, and i used the white and black coming into the circle to show it how feels for me with jagged and broken lines. The top left quadrant of the 12' vinyl is what I feel happiness is like. I did not want to do anything fancy or exquisite, rather warm comforting colors and shapes that are calming. The vinyl on the top right is my favorite vinyl based on execution and it represents heartbreak. The heart in the middle is broken and fading, while the coral around the heart is thriving and colorful. This is what I think it is like to be heartbroken as when dealing with heartbreak it feels like you are the only person going through hard times. The quadrant on the top right represents being in love and the heart is propped up and colorful while the coral around it is fading and not as important as the heart in the middle. I think this is what being in love feels like, because when someone has the feeling of love there is nothing more important to them. The vinyl on the bottom right is my representation of loneliness. The vinyl is gloomy and dark with rain clouds pouring on the landscape. There is a dead tree that is at the bottom of the hill, in comparison to the new saplings that are starting to grow together, leaving the old decrepit tree lonely and to ultimately perish. The bottom left quadrant of the 12' vinyl is a representation of togetherness. I portrayed this as a flashback and different view of when the dying tree had other trees around it that were thriving with a vibrant sky and promising soil.  The last 7' vinyl on the bottom right represents what anxiety feels like when i close my eyes. I used different colors that aren't super colorful and painted them all overlapping each other to some degree. The corresponding quadrant for it is my interpretation of calmness. This quadrant has most of the same colors used in anxiety, but has them all neatly unified and sharp. I decided to make my last project personal as I have been feeling these types of emotions throughout the past few months, and with summer coming up I want to resonate more with the 12' vinyl and think more positively. I chose to portray these emotions on vinyls because music is also a large way that I choose to express myself, and it is also an extension on my other project from the fall semester where I painted CD cases. `,
